Arcade game I did for a GameJolt game jam

Pretty simple game I did for the game jam found here http://jams.gamejolt.io/windowsformgames/games
This game ended up taking first place in the game jam but it is not good by any means. As promised though, I decided it was time to upload the source to github so that others could take a look at what I'd done.

Use Visual Studio 2015 to edit this. May end up doing another with better code to post here publicly.
